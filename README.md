# Incredibox (Flash Version)
Incredibox when it first appeared on Flash! <br>
(I do not own Incredibox, as it belongs to [So Far So Good](https://sofarsogood.fr).)

## Known Issues (at the time)
* In The Original, when you deselect a sound, the game becomes unplayable.
    * This means that sounds stop playing, animations won't play when you put down a sound, and selecting a bonus does nothing.
    * Additionally, the bonuses have no sound for some reason.
* V1: Alpha is currently unavailable at the moment. If the assets are found, they will be added here.
